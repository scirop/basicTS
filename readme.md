# Basic Time Series function library

This library is built with the basic theories of time series.

All of the formulations and ideas have been taken from the book on [Time-Series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_series) by [Pandit and Wu](https://www.amazon.com/System-Analysis-Applications-Sudhakar-Pandit/dp/0471868868)

Currently the Greens and Inverse function coefficients can be calculated using a GUI tool developed with tkinter
